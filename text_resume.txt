Experience:
Software Development Intern at ezDI, Ahmedabad
May 2016 - June 2016
- Worked on integrating a Business Intelligence tool that aggregates data from all of ezDI’s products for easy analytics.
- Was solely responsible for automating migration of data to a data warehouse (Amazon Redshift) using a custom server built on nodejs
using AWS APIs to replicate data and changes in RDS to Redshift through S3 at regular intervals.
- Implemented proof-of-concepts to embed a BI solution into the platform and set up base models to take advantage of reusable SQL views.

Software Team Member - Kraken 3.0 at Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Research Group, IIT Kharagpur
February 2015 - April 2016
- Worked on an autonomous underwater vehicle to represent India and IIT Kharagpur at competitions held in India and abroad.
- Worked in the Image Processing Team to implement algorithms in OpenCV and ROS for the bot to successfully complete multiple task
including Buoy detection and path following. Was part of the group implementing a Neural Network based adaptive image segmentation
to adopt to changing lighting conditions.

Academic Projects:
Title: Automated entity comparison for Wikipedia text corpora
- Implemented a novel comparative text mining task using a graph-based framework to model and measure semantic commonality and
currently working on improvising results for specific domains using Wikipedia, leveraging its distinct features.

Title: Lyrics generator using neural networks
- Currently working on a lyrics generator that generates a new song in an artist’s style. Created a database of song lyrics and used tensorflow to create a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network that learns artists’ styles of writing, including words, rhymes, chorus, etc.

Title: Lowpolify (Low-poly art generator)
- Created a web app that generates a low-poly art version of a given image that works by Delaunay Triangulation of points, using noise
reduction, edge detection and randomisation algorithms for improved results and parallel processing for rendering the output faster.

Title: Data extraction from biomedical literature for automating systematic reviews
- Worked on feature detection of a particular class of text (specifically, inclusion and exclusion criteria for patients) from a huge collection
of biomedical literature using NLP Techniques with high precision and recall.

Title: Selene (A community based music-recommendation engine)
- Built an Android app that serves as a social music-recommendation engine based on YouTube that extracts usage data from Selene users
who fall under a branch length of 5 nodes in a user’s Facebook friends graph, and recommends the most popular tracks among them.

Title: Retrieving salient sentences from Reddit AMAs
- Built a summariser that provides summaries from /r/iAMA, filtered by topic, with the abilities to choose any AMA through instant search.

Title: Studious (Course Management System)
- Built a complete course management system that supported authentication & authorization, User Access Control for 4 different types of
users, real-time messaging with notifications (using socket.io), calendar support and all major features one can expect from a CMS.

Hackathons & Workshops
Title: Data Extractor for 2D plots (OpenSoft 2016)
- Built a graph extractor that detects multi-variable graphs in any given PDF and tabulates them autonomously taking into consideration
features like axis values, scales and legends.

Title: Campus Connexions (Microsoft Code.Fun.Do 2015)
- Developed an intra-college social networking app with real time feed from registered users that would serve as a platform for official and
unofficial announcements related to the college.

Title: Object Follower Robot (Technology Robotix Society, IIT Kharagpur)
- Implemented image detection algorithms using openCV for a WSAD robot which can follow a specified path using the directives sent by
overhead camera whose recorded images were processed and movement instructions generated.
